        <h1>Megan McShea</h1>
        <p>Archivist</p>
	<p>My archival practice is dedicated to advancing my clientsâ€™ goals for stewardship of their archival collections. My primary expertise is in collection assessment and management, archival arrangement and description, and digitization and preservation, particularly for analog audiovisual materials. I have significant experience with grant writing, project management, standards implementation, workflow development, and digital asset management.</p>
<p>My approach seeks to center collaboration, to respect and engage existing knowledge and expertise, to build capacity wherever archives are housed, and to develop projects that value and sustain archival labor, wherever it takes place.</p>
