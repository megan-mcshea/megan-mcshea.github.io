        <h1>Megan McShea, archivist</h1>
	<p>My archival practice is dedicated to collaborating with clients to meet their goals for stewardship of their archives. My primary expertise is in collection assessment, collection management, archival arrangement and description, digitization, and preservation, especially for analog audiovisual materials. I have significant experience with grant writing, project management, standards implementation, workflow development, and digital asset management.</p>
<p>My work centers collaboration and respect for the knowledge and expertise of others, and aims to build capacity wherever archives are housed, through projects that value and sustain archival labor, whoever carries it out.</p>
