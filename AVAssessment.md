  <p>Megan's old Microsoft Access AV Survey database</p>
  <ul><li><a href="/AV%20survey%20blank%20copy.accdb">Blank database, circa 2018</a></li>
  <li><a href="/How%20to%20enter%20data%20in%20the%20AV%20Survey%20database.doc">Instructions for entering data</a></li>
  <li><a href="How%20to%20search%20the%20Audiovisual%20Survey%20database.docx">Instructions for searching database</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This old database is like a favorite pair of shoes that you should really throw away, but you save it because you spent a lot of your life in them, and they worked really well for you. I don't particularly recommend using it as-is, but I share it to give you the opportunity to poke around it as a learning resource.</p>
